About Search NEU
=================
**Built for students by students.** Search NEU is a web platform created to bring modern technology to the most difficult and archaic parts of higher education. We believe in the same things [Semester.ly](https://semester.ly) does: course registration is a pain. Spreadsheets, sticky notes, PDFs of course evaluations, and an outdated registration platform....it is all too much in the heat of classes and exams. We set out with the mission to make college more collaborative and more stress free.

What We Believe In
==================

Today, we work to solve many more exciting problems in this space across many more universities. However, our fundamental beliefs remain the same: 

Course registration should be easy
==================================

Picking the right classes should be quick and painless. We believe high quality, centralized, and shareable information makes for better decision making. By doing the legwork for you, we gives you more time to study for your courses, and decreases the time spent studying which classes to take.

Education should be collaborative
=================================

Studies show the positive impact that friendship has in higher education classrooms. Having courses with friends and a tigther knit university community increases student success and retention. That's why we helps students find courses with friends and helps new students make new friends in their classes.

Students know best
==================

Universities can't keep up with technology. Most university systems aren't even mobile responsive! Forget about using social media. That's why Search NEU and Semester.ly are built by students, and always will be. That's why we are open source. Oh, and it's why we use emojis 👍.
