Working with an outside sponsor, backed up by law school faculty, a student selects and refines an applied research topic, analyzes that topic, presents useful recommendations to the project sponsor, and creates a plan to implement those recommendations. Alongside this fieldwork, students will participate in an online course that provides a platform to develop, refine and practice key business communication skills, project and client management techniques, and analytic approaches. Each student receives feedback from both the project sponsor and course faculty, reviews “lessons learned,” and employs that feedback to advance his or her career development goals and professional plan.
